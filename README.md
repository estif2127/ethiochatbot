**Amharic Chat bot**

The Amharic Chat bot is a simple web application that allows users to have text-based conversations in the Amharic language. This app is designed to respond to user inputs with predefined responses, making it a basic conversational AI.

**Features**

Easy-to-use interface for text-based chat interactions.
Predefined responses for common user inputs and questions in Amharic.
Intent-based responses for a more dynamic conversation experience.
Simulated AI response delay for a more natural chat flow.
Customizable responses for specific intents.

**Getting Started**
To get started with the Amharic Chat bot, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

Open the index.html file in a web browser to run the application.

In the chat input field, type your messages in Amharic and click the "በላይ" (Send) button to send your message.

The chat app will respond based on predefined responses or intents. You can customize the responses by editing the script.js file.

Customizing Responses
You can customize the responses of the chat app by modifying the script.js file. The file contains a responses object that defines intents and their associated responses.

To add or edit responses, follow these guidelines:

Define a new intent in the intents object with an array of userInputs (user's possible questions or inputs) and an array of responses.

The app will choose a random response from the intent's responses when a user's input matches one of the userInputs.

You can customize the predefined responses in Amharic to make the app respond the way you prefer.

**Usage**
The Amharic Chat App can be used for:

Practicing Amharic language conversation.
Demonstrating a basic conversational AI concept.
Experimenting with intent-based chatbot responses.
